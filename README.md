State-of-Health (SOH) estimation is a critical aspect of managing Lithium-Ion batteries, 
ensuring their reliability and longevity in various applications, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. 
This paper presents a novel approach to SOH estimation using a Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). 
The methodology involves collecting historical battery data, preprocessing it, and designing a simple RNN architecture to predict the SOH. 
The RNN model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics. 
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in estimating the SOH of Lithium-Ion batteries. 
This research contributes to the development of accurate and efficient battery management systems, enhancing the overall performance and safety of battery-powered applications.
